# Large-scale sensor network on MeshCore
We build and share custom firmware and sensor solutions for LoRa mesh networks based on Meshcore.
- We develop optimized firmware for long-range, low-power mesh deployments.
- We integrate advanced sensor modules to deliver reliable, real-time environmental and infrastructure data.
- Using Meshcore as the backbone, we create scalable IoT solutions tailored for agriculture, smart cities, and industrial automation.

## Large-scale sensor applications
To form mass-scale solutions for sensors using long range mesh technology.
- Smart Agriculture: Monitor soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, and soil/water quality.
- Smart Cities: Manage street lighting, parking areas, warning systems, and environmental monitoring.
- Industry & Energy: Monitor electrical equipment, solar energy systems, substations, and fuel storage facilities.
- Security & Rescue: Establish mesh communication channels in emergency situations or areas without mobile coverage.
