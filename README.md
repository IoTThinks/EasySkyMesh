## Goals
Our goal is to make long-range, low-power communication accessible for everyone—whether you’re a hobbyist, maker, or developer.

## Mass-scale sensor applications
To form mass-scale solutions for sensors using long range mesh technology.
- Smart Agriculture: Monitor soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, and soil/water quality.
- Smart Cities: Manage street lighting, parking areas, warning systems, and environmental monitoring.
- Industry & Energy: Monitor electrical equipment, solar energy systems, substations, and fuel storage facilities.
- Security & Rescue: Establish mesh communication channels in emergency situations or areas without mobile coverage.
