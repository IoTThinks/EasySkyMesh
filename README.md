# Large-scale sensor applications on MeshCore
We build and share custom firmware and sensor solutions for LoRa mesh networks based on Meshcore.
- We develop optimized firmware for long-range, low-power mesh deployments.
- We integrate advanced sensor modules to deliver reliable, real-time environmental and infrastructure data.
- Using Meshcore as the backbone, we create scalable IoT solutions tailored for agriculture, smart cities, and industrial automation.

## PowerSaving MeshCore firmware: 
Feature firmwares are for Meshcore. They have more experimental, advances features and bug fixes. These features will be pushed to MeshCore to merge to the main development.
* Download at [RELEASES](https://github.com/IoTThinks/EasySkyMesh/releases)
* Please check the [**Instruction to flash custom firmware**](https://github.com/IoTThinks/EasySkyMesh/blob/main/firmware/Instruction-to-flash-firmware.md).
* Source code changes: [Source code](https://github.com/IoTThinks/MeshCore/tags)
